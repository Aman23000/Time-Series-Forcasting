# Climate Data Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project involves using TensorFlow to perform time series forecasting based on the Jena Climate dataset. The goal is to predict future climate parameters such as temperature using historical data.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or newer
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- IPython
- Streamlit

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python and pip.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow ipython streamlit
Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook and README.md file.
Run the notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
Data Loading and Cleanup

The data is automatically downloaded from the TensorFlow dataset repository. Initial cleaning involves removing any erroneous data and converting strings to datetime objects for time series manipulation.

Data Visualization

The data is visualized using matplotlib and seaborn to understand trends, seasonality, and correlations between different meteorological variables.

Feature Engineering

Features like wind speed and direction are engineered from the raw data to help the models understand patterns more effectively.

Model Training and Evaluation

The notebook includes several models:

A baseline model for comparison.
Linear and Dense models for simpler approaches.
LSTM models for capturing temporal dependencies.
Convolutional models for spatial feature extraction in sequence data.
Each model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and mean absolute error metrics.

Conclusion

The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow from data loading and preprocessing, through feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. It offers a solid base for further exploration and improvement, such as hyperparameter tuning or testing more complex models.

For more details, refer to the individual code cells in the Jupyter notebook which include comments and explanations about each step of the process.
